# E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

This is a robust **E-Commerce Platform** built with **Node.js**, **EJS**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The platform includes separate sections for users, sellers, and admins. Sellers can manage their product listings by adding or removing items, while users can browse products, add them to their cart, and complete purchases. Admins have full control over the platform, including managing users and sellers, monitoring orders, and moderating content. The platform also integrates **Razorpay**'s API for secure payment processing in a test environment.
